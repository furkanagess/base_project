# Flutter Base Project


-  This is a project template that includes several libraries to help in the development process of a Flutter project using the MVVM architecture. The template includes different layers such as base, constants, extensions, init, and view-model base. It also includes libraries for state management, localization, cache, network, and serialization, among others. The template has predefined code for building views and view-models, making it easier for developers to focus on page designs and business logic.

# Entegration Steps
  - 1-) Open the "flutter_base_project" file. (not with vscode, android studio, etc.) 
  - 2-) Copy the 'lib', 'assets', and 'scripts' files and paste them into your own project.
  - 3-) Integrate the libraries and assets into the "pubspec.yaml" folder.
  - 4-) Replace the imports in the closures with your **own project name** and fix the imports.

# Flutter Base Project Libraries
- State Management
  - mobx => https://pub.dev/packages/mobx
  - flutter_mobx => https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mobx
  - provider => https://pub.dev/packages/provider
  - mobx_codegen => https://pub.dev/packages/mobx_codegen
  - build_runner => https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner
  
- Localization
  - easy_localization => https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization 

- Cache
  - shared_preferences => https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences

- Network 
  - dio => https://pub.dev/packages/dio

- Serializable
  - json_serializable => https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable

# Project Layers
- Base 
  - Can be moved from project to project. The structures it contains can be used smoothly in every project.
  
  - In a project based on MVVM architecture, we create the base structures of Model-View-ViewModel layers from here.
 
- Constants 
  - Folder where values that will not change throughout the application and can be used from start to finish are kept.
  
  - Includes Navigation names that will be used by application Path, Enum values, Image constants, Navigation paths.
  
- Extensions
  - Extensions that can be used in every part of the project in terms of clean code mentality are essential.

  - context_extension => the place where values such as width, height, padding, and duration are kept within the application.
  
- Init
  - The place where important controls such as cache, lang, navigation, network, notifier, and theme are managed for a mobile application.
  
  - cache => contains locale manager for managing application cache in this section.
  
  - lang => contains language manager for localization. For localization, the languages that will be localized should be put into folders such as en-US.json, tr-TR.json under assets/lang. After any changes made in these folders, the command "flutter pub run easy_localization:generate -O lib/core/init/lang -f keys -o locale_keys.g.dart -S assets/lang" should be written in the terminal.
  
  - navigation => the place where navigation service and navigation routes are provided.
  
  - network => used for managing web scraping operations from websites using Dio
  
  - notifier =>  manages theme changes between dark and light themes with theme notifier.
  
  - theme => used for managing the application's theme.
  
# View-ViewModel Base  
- After completing the architectural development processes specified in the Project Layers section, we can start filling the views and viewModels of the application in general.
- In this section, we see how we can use our application's views and viewModels in an integrated way with the code we wrote in the base layer.
  
   # ViewModel
     - When we start to make the ViewModel section, we first start to generate a viewModel code using the mobx snippet. (*Note that build_runner_watch is active during this process.*)
     
     - After completing this process, mobx_codegen starts writing the generated codes to the viewModel.g.dart folder on our behalf.
     
     - While developing our ViewModel, we use the base_view_model we made in the base section. For this process, we add the class with Store, BaseViewModel structure to the class to derive it from the BaseViewModel class.
     
     - After adding these structures, we integrate our setContext() and init() functions from our base_view_model."

   # View
     - When starting to fill the View section, we first utilize the view_base we developed in the base section.
     - To draw our page, we add our BaseView to the return section, but this BaseView must be derived from the viewModel (e.g.: BaseView<LoginViewModel>())
     - After integrating the BaseView, we start filling in the code we wrote in the base_view section here.
 
     - viewModel => We give the viewModel of the page we drew as explained above.
     - onModelReady => We control the context interaction of the model we gave.
     - onPageBuilder => This is the section where we start drawing our page.
